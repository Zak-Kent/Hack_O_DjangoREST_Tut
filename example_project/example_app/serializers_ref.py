"""
Use this file as a reference for the different ways to make a serializer

'Serializers allow complex data such as querysets and model instances to be 
converted to native Python datatypes that can then be easily rendered into 
JSON or XML' DRF docs: http://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/relations/

Anytime you want to inspect what a serializer is doing open the manage.py shell 
and take a look using the commands below: 

    >>> python manage.py shell 
    >>> from example_app.serializers import my_serializer 
    >>> from example_app.models import Songs
    >>>
    >>> serializer_instance = my_serializer()
    >>> print(repr(my_serializer))

    entering the commmands below will show you what the example data looks like 
    >>> all_songs = Songs.objects.all()
    >>> serialized_songs = my_serializer(all_songs, many=True)

This will print the current repersentation of the serializer and show you what 
it is currently evaluating

    Using ModelSerializer makes it much easier to set up serialization for
    data. The meta sub class requires at least two values 'model' and 'fields'
    you see below. 

    * by using fields = '__all__' you're telling the serializer to include all 
    model fields in the objects that are passed through it. 
    You could also explictly declare what fields you wanted serialized here if 
    a subset of all the fields in the model are needed.
